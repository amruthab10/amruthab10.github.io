## Professional: 

1. Clinical Nutrition Intern, NYU Langone
At NYU Langone, I worked alongside registered dietitians to interpret electronic health record (EHR) and laboratory data, developing personalized, evidence-based nutrition plans for post-operative patients. I also evaluated patient feedback and dietary metrics to refine menu design, ultimately improving satisfaction outcomes and supporting recovery efficiency.

2. Lead Research Assistant, The College of New Jersey – Department of Public Health (Dementia Project)
As a Research Assistant for a New Jersey Department of Health–funded dementia project, I designed and deployed Qualtrics surveys to evaluate caregiver training programs. I managed data collection and IRB documentation, while cleaning and analyzing data in SPSS, R, and Excel. Through statistical testing and interpretation—including t-tests, ANOVA, and regression—I helped generate actionable insights that informed state-level policy reports.

3. Graduate Research Assistant, The College of New Jersey – Department of Public Health (Legionella Project)
I contributed to a $2.1 million EPA-funded research initiative focused on Legionella detection and prevention. My responsibilities included conducting data mining, performing PCR analyses, and executing exploratory data analysis in R and Excel. I modeled water quality trends and created data visualizations that guided environmental health policy and infection-control strategies.

4. Business Innovation & GPD Intern, Pfizer- 
During my internship at Pfizer, I supported the Regulatory Intelligence and Submission Systems (RISS) team as they prepared for FDA and EMA drug approvals. I developed three internal technical guides and collaborated with cross-functional teams to audit and migrate over 500 scientific protocols from a legacy system (E-Workbook) to a new digital platform, improving data accessibility for R&D. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience querying internal databases using SQL and contributed to documentation of mock Discovery Protocols in GEPR to strengthen regulatory readiness.

5. Research Assistant, Drexel University – WELL Center
At Drexel University’s WELL Center, I supported behavioral health research focused on eating patterns and outcomes. I designed REDCap surveys, managed and cleaned participant datasets, and drafted study protocols for hybrid research designs. My role also included monitoring real-time participant data to ensure integrity and reliability for ongoing analyses.
