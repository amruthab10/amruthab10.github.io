Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Amrutha Banda, and I’m a Master of Science student in Biostatistics and Data Science at Columbia University. This site highlights my academic background, research experiences, and professional journey across healthcare, epidemiology, and digital health innovation. You’ll also find links to my GitHub, resume, and interactive data visualizations created in R. Learn more about me over [here](about.html).
